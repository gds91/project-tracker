# project-tracker

A project tracker app built with typescript.

There are 2 versions of this project: the 'base' version that has all the code contained within a single .ts file and the 'implementing_imports'\
version that uses imports and implements webpack.

## Installation (For the implementing_imports only)

- Install nodejs
- Open the terminal and navigate to `implementing_imports` and run `npm install` to install dependencies

## Others

- If needed, to create a new list of dependencies, type `npm shrinkwrap` in the terminal
